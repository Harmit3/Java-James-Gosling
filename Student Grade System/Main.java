/**
Project:  Student Grading System
Programming Language: Java
Author: Harmit Patel
Date: 4th July,2024.

Purpose:

   The Student Grading System is designed to manage a list of students, providing
   functionalities to add, remove, search, and display student records.

   It  ensures that student IDs and names are unique, enforcing data integrity.

   Additionally, the system calculates and displays the average grade of all students,
   identifies students with the highest and lowest grades, and handles scenarios where
   multiple students have the same highest or lowest grades.

   User interaction is facilitated through a command-line menu, enabling efficient
   management and retrieval of student data.

Key Features:

  - Add, remove, search, and display student records
  - Ensures unique student IDs and names
  - Computes and displays average grade
  -Identifies students with highest and lowest grades
  - Handles multiple students with the same highest or lowest grades
  - User-friendly command-line interface for interaction and operation


 This system aims to provide a robust tool for educational institutions to manage
 student grading information effectively and accurately.
